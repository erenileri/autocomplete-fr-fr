# Introduction
An [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) provider completing French words with the hint of French explanation.

This package requires [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) and [fuzzaldrin](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin).
The package [fuzzaldrin](https://github.com/atom/fuzzaldrin) is one of the core package of atom which has been installed by default. This package offers a fuzzy match function which is useful for uncertain words. The dictionary is based on the Oxford advanced learner dictionary.

# Usage
For the defined file types, it will complete automatically.

 The default setting includes text file, latex file, markdown file, null grammar file. If you need to add your file type, add the type string in the setting panel.

To enable completion for your current file type, open one of the file and put your cursor in, open the Command Palette (cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p), and run the: "Log Cursor Scope" command. This will trigger a notification which will contain a list of scopes. The first scope that's listed is the one you should add to the list of scopes in the settings for the package. Here are some examples: .source.gfm (markdown file), .text.plain (text file), .text.tex.latex (latex file).
